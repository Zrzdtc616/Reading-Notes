# 英文诗两首 Two English Poems   
献给贝阿特丽斯 比维罗尼 韦伯斯特 德布尔里奇   

## I 

The useless dawn finds me in a deserted street- 
corner; I have outlived the night. 
Nights are proud waves; darkblue topheavy waves 
laden with all the hues of deep spoil, laden with 
things unlikely and desirable. 
Nights have a habit of mysterious gifts and refusals, 
of things half given away, half withheld, 
of joys with a dark hemisphere. Nights act 
that way, I tell you. 
The surge, that night, left me the customary shreds 
and odd ends: some hated friends to chat 
with, music for dreams, and the smoking of 
bitter ashes. The things my hungry heart 
has no use for. 
The big wave brought you. 
Words, any words, your laughter; and you so lazily 
and incessantly beautiful. We talked and you 
have forgotten the words. 
The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street 
of my city. 
Your profile turned away, the sounds that go to 
make your name, the lilt of your laughter: 
these are the illustrious toys you have left me. 
I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them, I find 
them; I tell them to the few stray dogs and 
to the few stray stars of the dawn. 
Your dark rich life ... 
I must get at you, somehow; I put away those 
illustrious toys you have left me, I want your 
hidden look, your real smile -- that lonely, 
mocking smile your cool mirror knows. 

## II 

What can I hold you with? 
I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the 
moon of the jagged suburbs. 
I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked 
long and long at the lonely moon. 
I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts 
that living men have honoured in bronze: 
my father's father killed in the frontier of 
Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs, 
bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in 
the hide of a cow; my mother's grandfather 
--just twentyfour-- heading a charge of 
three hundred men in Peru, now ghosts on 
vanished horses. 
I offer you whatever insight my books may hold, 
whatever manliness or humour my life. 
I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never 
been loyal. 
I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved, 
somehow --the central heart that deals not 
in words, traffics not with dreams, and is 
untouched by time, by joy, by adversities. 
I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at 
sunset, years before you were born. 
I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about 
yourself, authentic and surprising news of 
yourself. 
I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the 
hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you 
with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat. 

\- Jorge Luis Borges (1934) 



## 一


在荒凉的街角，无用的黎明

将我找到；我已活过这个夜晚。



夜晚是高傲的浪潮；失衡的暗蓝色巨浪

满载着深渊废土的一切色彩，

满载着求之而不得的事物。



夜晚有神秘的赠予与拒绝之习性，

一半给出、一半保留的东西之习性，

背阳半球的喜悦之习性。

夜晚就这样行事，我告诉你。



波涛，那一晚，留给我平常的碎片与

古怪的余物：和讨厌的朋友聊天，

梦的音乐，以及苦涩灰烬的弥散。

这些被我饥饿的心所厌恶的东西。



大浪带来了你。



言语，任何言语，你的笑声；以及你，

如此懒散而不渝地美丽。我们交谈

然后你忘记了这些言语。



骇人的黎明找到我，在我城市里一条荒凉的街。



你转过去的侧脸，组成你名字的声音，

你笑声的调子：这些是你留给我的

伟大玩具。



我在黎明中将它们玩味，我失去它们，我

找到它们；我把它们讲给一些流浪的狗，

讲给黎明里一些流浪的星星。



你黯淡而丰富的一生……



我必须触及你，以某种方式；我收好你留给我的

伟大玩具，我想要你隐藏的面貌、

你真实的笑容——那为你冰冷的镜子所知的，

孤独的、嘲弄的笑容。


## 二 What can I hold you with? 我用什么才能留住你？

I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs.  

我给你贫穷的街道、绝望的日落、破败郊区的月亮。  

I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon.  

我给你一个久久地望着孤月的人的悲哀。  

I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts that living men have honoured in marble: my father’s father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow; 

my mother’s grandfather -just twentyfour- heading a charge of three hundred men in Perú, now ghosts on vanished horses.I offer you whatever insight my books may hold. whatever manliness or humour my life.  

我给你我已死去的先辈，人们用大理石纪念他们的幽灵：在布宜偌斯艾利斯边境阵亡的我父亲的父亲，两颗子弹穿了他的胸膛。蓄着胡子的他死去了，士兵们用牛皮裹起他的尸体；我母亲的祖父——时年二十四岁——在秘鲁率领三百名士兵冲锋，如今都成了消失的马背上的幽灵。  

我给你我写的书中所能包含的一切悟力、我生活中所能有的男子气概或幽默。  

I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.  

我给你一个从未有过信仰人的忠诚。  

I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved somehow -the central heart that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.   

我给你我设法保全的我自己的核心——不营字造句，不和梦想交易，不被时间、欢乐和逆境触动的核心。  

I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born.  

我给你，早在你出生前多年的一个傍晚看到的一朵黄玫瑰的记忆。  

I offer you explanationsof yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself.  

我给你对自己的解释，关于你自己的理论，你自己的真实而惊人的消息。  
 
I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.  

我给你我的寂寞、我的黑暗、我心的饥渴；我试图用困惑、危险、失败来打动你。
